Very simple React app with authentication using Auth0.

## Simple React.js User Login Authentication 

In this markdown file, I'll show you a basic user login with authentication to a `React.js` app using Auth0 which is the easiest way for developers to add authentication. 

- Open a blank project folder and open new terminal in VS code. Then type

1. `expo init react-auth0`
2. choose workflow type (blank managed - first one)

Here _react-auth0_ is the project folder name.

- `npx create-react-app .`
- `cd react-auth0` and `code .`

Auth0 package installation: 

- `npm i @auth0/auth0-react`

After writing in VS code, run the program, type:

- `npm start`


**NOTE: You must enter your environmental variables for this to work correctly.**
